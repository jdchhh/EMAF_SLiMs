This project implements a multi-modal protein classifier that integrates features from ProtBERT embeddings, PSSM (Position-Specific Scoring Matrix), and physicochemical properties using attention mechanisms and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The model is trained and tested on labeled protein sequences for binary classification tasks.
